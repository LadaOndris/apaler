## Testdataset

The test dataset is used for evaluating laser detection algorithms.

The dataset is generated by `src/testdataset/generation/dataset.py`
using images located in `dataset/testdataset/images/` and specified settings.

The `evaluation.py` script evaluates the given detection
algorithm on all generated images in `dataset/testdataset/i*`. 
The number after the character `i` specifies the intensity of 
the laser, meaning that this value was added to pixels where the laser is present.

The best parameters for the Rotlinedet algorithm can be determined
using the `bestparams.py` script, which runs evaluation for different parameters
and prints the best ones.


## Localization

All source files regarding laser origin localization are present in the `src/localization/` folder.

For testing purposes, a `data_generation.py` script was created 
to generate `synthetic` images with lasers (black images with clearly visible lines).

The localiation is perfomed by `laser_source.py`, which reads two images,
finds lasers in the synthetic images using HoughTransform (for now), and 
determines the laser origin.
