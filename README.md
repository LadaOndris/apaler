## Testdataset

The test dataset is used for evaluating laser detection algorithms.

The dataset is generated by `src/testdataset/generation/dataset.py`
using images located in `dataset/testdataset/images/` and specified settings.

The `src/testdataset/evaluation.py` script evaluates the given detection
algorithm on all generated images in `dataset/testdataset/i*`. 
The number after the character `i` specifies the intensity of 
the laser, meaning that this value was added to pixels where the laser is present.

## Localization

All source files regarding laser origin localization are present in the `src/localization/` folder.

For testing purposes, a `data_generation.py` script was created 
to generate `synthetic` images with lasers (black images with clearly visible lines).

The localiation is perfomed by `laser_source.py`, which reads two images,
finds lasers in the synthetic images using HoughTransform (for now), and 
determines the laser origin.
